## About Me

I’m Dohyun Kim, an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University, advised by [Prof. Paul Hongsuck Seo](https://phseo.github.io) in the [Multimodal Interactive Intelligence Laboratory (MIIL)](https://miil.korea.ac.kr).

My research interests center on multimodal and generative models, with a particular focus on diffusion models. I have worked on topics such as data-efficient compression of diffusion models and preference-based optimization for text-to-image generation. I am broadly open to diverse directions in generative AI, multimodal learning, and beyond.
